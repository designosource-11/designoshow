                the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure 
                your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be 
                guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other 
                unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal,
                 or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission
                  of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
                   within a secure environment.

                information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

            <li>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</li>
            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a 
                Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not 
                to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no 
                uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. 
                As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that 
                automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online 
                tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice 
                in a revised version of this privacy notice. 
            </p>

            <li>DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</li>

                Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated 
                by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is 
                accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either 
                by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. 
                We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are 
                protecting your information.
